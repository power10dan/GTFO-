# GTFO-
An App I created during HWWeekend. This app helps its users find the optimal path to escape a dangerous situation, 
and helps disaster planners learn where people are going in order to help find better locations to setup FEMA camps. Below is a small screenshot of how the app looks like:

In this screen shot, the black line is the best path to escape out of San-Francisco. We assumed that there exist a hurricane and the user of the app wants to find the quickest route out of San-Francisco.
